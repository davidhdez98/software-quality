# PAI Lab assignment (lab, class presentation with slides) structure

This directory is organised as follows:

      .
      ├── coverage   # Code coverage reports files
      ├── docs       # All kind of project documentation, including JSDoc files
      ├── image      # Image resources 
      ├── tests      # Source code for tests
      ├── src        # Source code, including JS, CSS, HTML

For each assignment there should be a markdown file with the assignment description.
Find that file and follow the instructions on it.

**Before** the evaluation session of the assignment, **do not forget** to upload the (git) link to your repository to the Moodle classroom.
